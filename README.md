## What is it ?

Statues (also known as Red Light, Green Light in North America, and Grandma's/Grandmother's Footsteps or Fairy Footsteps in the United Kingdom) is a popular children's game, often played in different countries. How the game is played varies throughout different regions of the world. 

### Principles

1.  A person starts out as the "[Curator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curator "Curator")" (It, Granny, Pooh, etc.) and stands at the end of a field. Everyone else playing stands at the far end (distance depends upon playing area selected). The object of the game is for a "Statue" to tag the Curator, thereby becoming the Curator and resetting the game.
2.  The Curator turns their back to the field, and the "Statues" attempt to race across and tag the Curator.
3.  Whenever the Curator turns around, the Statues must freeze in position and hold that for as long as the Curator looks at them. The Curator may even be allowed to walk around the Statues, examining them. However, the Curator needs to be careful -- whenever the Curator's back is turned, Statues are allowed to move.
4.  If a Statue is caught moving, they are sent back to the starting line to begin again or eliminated.

### Game description

The current game follows the same steps from the squid game version. 

#### example

-  Doll turns back till countdown stop , player can move during that time
-  Doll turns front till countdown starts, player cannot move 
-  If player breaks one of these rules it is game over!
